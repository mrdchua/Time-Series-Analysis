    "# **The Solar Cycle**\n",
    "The solar magnetic activity cycle, sunspot cycle, Schwabe cycle, or simple the **solar cycle**, is a nearly periodic 11-year change in the Sun's activity measured in terms of changes in the number of observed sunspots on the Sun's surface [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnetic field of the Sun flips during each solar cycle, with the flip occurring when the solar cycle is near its maximum. After two solar cycles, the Sun's magnetic field returns to its original state, completing what is known as a Hale cycle [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding and predicting the solar cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the universe [1].**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we perform preliminary exploration of the available datasets from Ref. [2].\n",
